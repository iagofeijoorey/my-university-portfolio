## Description

These are the files for my third big assigment for the subject "Algoritmos e Estructuras de Datos".  
This project was made in C.  

The project consisted on creating a terminal application that can manage a graph of cities connected by either road or highway. The program allows you to create new cities, create new links between cities, found the best routes between two different cities and also find the best way to connect all of them with a single line that cannot touch the same city twice.

I was given the files called "grafo.h" and "grafo.c" but i had to change the definition of the struct to to adapt it to the statement of the project. I had to also modifiy the structure of most of the funcitions to adapt them to the last changes.  

Files "main.c", "ETSEmaps.h", "ETSEmaps.c" and "ETSEmaps.txt" are mine.

## Description

These are the files for my third big assigment for the subject "Algoritmos e Estructuras de Datos".  
This project was made in C.  

The project consisted on creating a terminal application that can manage the structure of printers in a certain building of a certain company. You can add or remove printers from the building, access the list of printers, view pending print jobs for all printers, add jobs to a printer's print queue, and search for printers with low printing load.  

I was given the files called "grafo.h" and "grafo.c" but i had to change the definition of the struct to to adapt it to the statement of the project. I also had to modifiy the structure of most of the funcitions to adapt them to the last changes.  

Files "main.c", "ETSEmaps.h", "ETSEmaps.c" and "ETSEmaps.txt" are mine.

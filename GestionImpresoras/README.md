## Description

These are the files for my first big assigment for the subject "Programaci√≥n 2".  
This project was made in C.

The project consisted on creating a terminal application that can manage the structure of printers in a certain building of a certain company. You can add or remove printers from the building, access the list of printers, view pending print jobs for all printers, add jobs to a printer's print queue, and search for printers with low printing load.

I was given the files called "lista.h", "lista.c", "cola.h" and "cola.c" but i had to change the definition of some of the structures and also add one function in "cola.c".
Files "main.c", "makefile" and "lista.txt" are mine.

## Instalation
These are the files for a C project, it has also an .exe file which can be used to execute the program in your computer.
You may create your own .exe by running the makefile file in Linux.
The program can be run by running the command "./ejecutable" from the folder in which you downloaded all the files. 
By running "./ejecutable -f *" where * is the name of a .txt file, you can save and open a list of printers which can be modified with this program.
